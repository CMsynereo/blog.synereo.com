## Update Summary
Our weekly hangout brought us many interesting conversations. This week we discussed a new, more accessible version of the white paper (add link here), we also focused on the UI, which should be tested by the community.

Other discussions included the need for a technical channel that should focus on technical aspects of the platform, to allow onboarding a wider array of people, which is one of Synereo's main goals in terms of early adoption.

Alan presented a new application pitch, a Task manager uses and involves a lot of Synereo's features.  

Also discussed was the upcoming crowd sale, connections to angel investors, our participation in the blockchain workshops in New York, and the need for whitelisted applications, which are able to show the potential of the Synereo platform.

## Detailed notes

[00:01 - Start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_BxakTpizs)<BR>
Dor talks about a new version of the white paper, which is more accessible to non-technical people. Chris wants to do the task and also a fresh pitch deck. The new community leader Chris, was also active as a community leader with Factom and is currently working on the Bitland project. Dor mentions in general, that the people who want to help out have the full freedom to do what they think is best for the Synereo community.

[05:42 - A couple of updates](https://youtu.be/m_BxakTpizs?t=343)<BR>
There is a new DevOp Team, it is planned so that the client side becomes an executable file to examine how the API works. Also, work is being done on having a docker, a virtual box and an amazon image. Mal is working on converting the virtual box images into the docker images.

[09:42 - UI progress](https://youtu.be/m_BxakTpizs?t=583)<BR>
Navneet talks about the upcoming images and also about a full flash image, which is coming fully packed inside. Greg talks about a graphic interface which allows you to connect different nodes and more. It is important to allow fast growth of the network, and with people who are not so nerdy, in contrast to the majority of the early community.

[15:00 - New York blockchain workshop](https://youtu.be/m_BxakTpizs?t=900)<BR>
Greg and Dor will be in New York for a blockchain workshop and also some internal workshops. They plan to run a demo on a presentation panel and Ed wants to organize some pitches for investors. A new communication channel, which focuses more on the technical and Dev aspects of Synereo will be added soon. He wants to have a weekly hangout with the idea to bring more developers on board.

[17:12 - Coming crowdsale](https://youtu.be/m_BxakTpizs?t=1032)<BR>
Chris asks if people participating in the coming crowdsale would also be owners of the synereo company, which was answered by Greg. The coming crowdsale will include equity and the concept is a community governance structure.

[23:21 - UI progress II](https://youtu.be/m_BxakTpizs?t=1401)<BR>
Navneet wants to post a primary version of the UI, so people can play around with it. Feedback from people who are willing to test is much appreciated. We will have a single repository for the UI part and additionally, it is planned to setup a focus group.

[28:52 - Project high-school kids](https://youtu.be/m_BxakTpizs?t=1732)<BR>
Jonny is doing a lot of work with highschool kids and college students, and he has a group of students who are quite interested in Synereo. He can organize focus groups to get input from, and find out what they want in a future social platform, and also what they don't like in existing social platforms.

[30:41 - The need of more channels](https://youtu.be/m_BxakTpizs?t=1841)<BR>
Greg talks about the need for more channels to organize and manage the tasks more efficiently. As an example, a tech channel, or focus group channels (both for the UI side, and the client side) with the goal to get more people involved.

[34:18 -  The advantages of synereo over competitors](https://youtu.be/m_BxakTpizs?t=2058)<BR>
The advantages of Synereo over possible competitors was brought up. The most urgent advantages are the reputation model, attention model, and the underlying mathematical model, which shows up not only in the area of social media, but also in the field of big data, complex event processing and many more. The new social model is that people can earn money through bounties.

[44:11 - Question about the security of the synereo network](https://youtu.be/m_BxakTpizs?t=2651)<BR>
Malthus John asks a question about the security of the Synereo network which is not on the blockchain. Greg explains that encryption is only the last layer of security and gives an example that security through obscurity can be very powerful. It can be very hard to guess the channels where the conversation occurred. This layer of security can give you a much higher security level than encryption and it's a bit like finding a needle in a haystack. 

[47:47 - Project taskmanager](https://youtu.be/m_BxakTpizs?t=2867)<BR>
Alan presents a new application pitch, an idea of an app that can be used to organize your task lists. He wants to create a task list app, which is simple but able to twist, and can demonstrate some showcases, which the Synereo platform is able to do. The depth of the app comes from the ability to connect with other people on the platform, so that you can receive hints and different kinds of input. The app should help you work through the day and improve your work-life balance, whereas it should also be made fun to use.

[53:41 - Developer fund for whitelisted applications](https://youtu.be/m_BxakTpizs?t=3221)<BR>
Greg said that Dor had a nice idea about a developer fund, a whitelist of applications that are able to show the value of the Synereo platform if needed, and also helps to engage the community and potential developers even more. Also, when using all the different channels (Google, Taiga, Slack, Hangouts), we should think about how we want it to happen in Synereo. 

[55:13 - Synereo, blockchain, social technology and game theories](https://youtu.be/m_BxakTpizs?t=3313)<BR>
Greg talks about the possibilities of the modern communication layer, the role of blockchain technology and the missing aspects of modern social technology, which focus mainly on collaboration. He mentions that gamification can unlock a lot of capacities, which are not often touched, and he explains that all 3 game theories in mathematics have unlocked and solved a lot of fundamental mathematical problems. He concludes that gamification is a crucial step in developing social technology and that Synereo reflects only one layer, which can support the process of coordination and collaboration.

[01:03:23 - New York blockchain workshop II](https://youtu.be/m_BxakTpizs?t=3800)<BR>
Dor asks if there are already applications that can be presented on the platform, and if anyone has connections to small angel-like investors, who he can meet during the New York blockchain workshop.
