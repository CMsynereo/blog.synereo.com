##[Detailed notes]

###[03:00 ---Technical Dev]() <br>
Greg Begins with the Technical Devs. He talks about the DVI version(downloadable) and some concepts about building the HTTP bridge and supporting a new non 2Factor for user creation. Dor, Gary & Eric are forming a devs team to push new version of deployment. Anybody interested in join the devs team there are AMPs available. In addition about the Casperfront, devs group is trying to get a HASH, and what the stake at the system will be next vs betting on BLOCKS. If those strategies could be combined. Using blocks the problem is that the confirmation times for transactions spends much time. Another problem,   you can’t potentially have validators that are built on stake groups that are inconsistent with betting on Blocks. Also instead of betting in stake groups or Blocks there have been taking into account other options like properties that define group of blocks, etc (which logic have been written during the weekend).

[09:30 ---UI Updates]() <br>
Eric Talks about the connectivity between the UI and the server. It is checked the post creation and the next steps are the contract creation and aggregation of the wallet. He shows an example of the responsive UI and some good properties of the built system.  Also tells us about some improving server processes, friend invitations and other issues. He speaks  about continuous working on marketing and market research like interviews and freelancers.

[12:45 ---Agenda and Canvas - Dor]() <br>
Developers are needed, We have funds not only to pay with AMPs, as well as with FIAT$. Then he talks about that they are going to be in NY for some important agenda. They are going to meet with Filippi who could help us to create a decentralized model for Synereo. In the next point Dor explain that we are studying possibilities for the distributed community government and that those experiments are made in the” Loomio”, which is a deliberative web application. Granting in this way that decision can be taken by community members.
He also has designed the basic canvas (pretty beautiful) and explains how it is distributed, with a main clear feed where attention is focused . On the left we would have the map of the network where contents would be amplified; and remarking that you have the total control of the information shared with anyone.  Greg joins on explain what roll makes the socials contracts and their importance.  He also tell us about how the Smart interaction with the content happens  and how you can empower it with the rest of the network and the role of reputation on it. Greg talks about the needings of a presentation, where one of the main points is the attention, and explaining that having this clear, algorithms could work in that way and would focus better in the priorities. After that, Eric and Greg discuss about the economy of attention and their interaction as well as the prioritization  when multiple feeds are involve.

[37:30 ---Testing and Privacy]() <br>
Alan start telling us about the testing process, explaining that is being working in a A-B testing model and note about an analyst platform. That is where anything can be added and tested and is coordinated by a node (not by a centralized server) trying to get an environment where all can be optimized. Dor tells him that the job is being done with the UXPin platform.
Ryan and Greg remark the importance that Synereo will keep the privacy of the users and their data. Is a very important point that should concern everyone and the Synereo team is working for the maximum success of protecting users. One of the tool to reach this is call “social contract” which is being developed. Eric and Alan explain their point about.
[30:54 ---BnkToTheFuture Campaign and Market Price]() <br>
<br>![image](http://i.imgur.com/BotYEkF.jpg)<br> 
Dor comment the recently interest on cryptocoins has grown due to increase Price and is being studied the possibility that selling AMPs could be use as funding increasing in that way the waves of interest in cryptocoins. After that he talk about the BnkToTheFuture Campaigning for those who invest having equity. Anyway still no decisions have being taken. 
Jonny joins the conversation explaining that he thinks that BnkToTheFuture could be used in conjunction with other methods of raising capital, he says that one of Synereo strengths is as a framework layer, on which many apps can leverage Synereo’s tools,  creating a whole ecosystem of DAPPS which can all benefit from Synereo’s fundraising goals.
.
Market Price –
Dor ask opinions for a way to fix the possibility of market manipulation. Maybe with a fixed Price, or other solutions like an average method. All this related to the crowdsale and to get a fair Price. Several opinions were in the table and Greg speak about discount for equity holders,  due that investors are who are holding the risk

[47:55 ---Governance]() <br>
The first approximation is that community will have a voice without known the details of input right now while Synereo still isn’t deployed. Also on that Sunday this was discussed with all the community leaders and a creation of a separate Loomio for all the community members and for now the structure would be the directors, community leaders, the designers and a general section for the public. Jonny tell his thoughs about to re-engage the structure relative to the holders but Greg remarks him that today all the decisions are determined by the community (not the directors, nor investors.. ) and give the example of the crowdsale and the commitments with BnkToTheFuture. Greg also reminds that there are being made videos, guides… whatever is needed to make the process clear and ensuring all the community feels in the same way. Jonny also suggest a marketing campaign towards the next crowdsale. Jonny, Greg and Eric speaks about the resources management and the importance of let the people know what are them for, and how are them used. Reporting all very clear. Greg says we are today in the position of spend wisely resources and Jonny suggest organize them to give them a quick and structured  approach of what is needed. Alan suggest some kind of constitution and Greg building from this talks about a place where all the possible people could join and get consensus.

##That's all for this week!!
